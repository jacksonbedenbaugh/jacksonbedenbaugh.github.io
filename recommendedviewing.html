<h1 style="text-align: center">&ensp;I. The American Psychic Experience</h1>
<p style="color:red;">
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Movies which put on display the grotesque American conception of the world and of itself. This list includes movies that, on the one hand, are conscious of and intentionally presenting a crtique (e.g., Sorry to Bother You, Network). On the other hand are those films, which in their mission to soothe, entertain, and congratulate the American consciousness, capture (with savant-like clarity) something true about the uniquely confused, vain, and loathesome character of the American Oversoul (e.g., The Blind Side, God's Not Dead 2). We might call this latter category <i>footage</i> in order to distinguish it from the first. There are a lot of movies that manage to do a little bit of both, and in their projects of American self-examination reveal as much about the observer as the observed (e.g., Richard Jewell, Dances With Wolves). To some extent this is true of the first category as well; a frenchman once stumbled on the correct insight that there are no anti-war movies. As such, there are no American anti-American movies. There are innumerable examples of non-USian or otherwise subaltern films that are, in fact, subversive and anti-American and remain purely in the first category, but I am not familiar enough with this world to speak it's language. As such, I'll relegate myself almost exclsuively to the canonical American spectacularum (feature films).<br><br>

  &emsp;&emsp;It may seem that this film is just another Spielberg brand crime against emotional dignity, but under the limited-hangout homeland security apologia I think you can find a kind of illuminating look at the American psychic landscape at the end of history, the encroaching sense that cannibalism couldn't be laundered as resourcefulness and prosperity any longer but that it could be sustained by virtue of the belief. This movie came out 14 months after the invasion of Iraq, and seems perfectly designed for the kind of person who never doubted the WMDs. an ignorance of american character and psychology that could only ever come out of the rarefied american mind.</td>

  &emsp;&emsp;A gear shift in terms of the Coens' usual delivery, and they pulled it off superbly. On several occains speaks directly to the audience but they've done such a good job reversing their usual (and great!) course of maintaining a gesture to and recognition of the audience that it doesn't feel like it's a movie talking to you. That's really Tommy Lee Jones there in front of you blaming kids with piercings for the salivating maw of evil that capitalism and calvinist psychosis has hung over each of us, constantly terrifying or forcing us away from any relationship with our vulnerability and mortality that isn't willful denial and/or panicked desperation.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I watched this once with my dad and my mom's dad, and at the end of the movie my dad (who, regarding most movies, is just happy to be there) asked my granddad what he thought. He said he hadn't liked the ending. His favorite book is Lonesome Dove, which is also his favorite movie. I guess in Lonesome Dove a bunch of horrible and nasty stuff happens, people die arbitrarily because of horrors manmade and natural, etc., etc., and despite it all they get the cattle to the ranch and get paid and get ready to do it all over again next year (I have neither seen nor read Lonesome Dove, but imagine it's like a grislier <i>City Slickers</i> without Billy Crystal). In sum, lots of nasty, brutish, and short experiences of life, but all easily romantically glossed by the aging suburban male who is in some sense validated and justified in their lifestyles by consuming the reality presented these westerns.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I think the rub here for my granddad was that there wasn't anything that could be called an unalloyed heroism or virtue, no natural justice, no reconciliation of or with struggle, only the observation of pain. The violence that, even if it destroys what we are made to accept as a hero in the end, does not thereby justify, glorify, or raise into the halls of the saints the victims of the conclusive cold blooded murder of our man on the run. There was never a way things use to be before the kids started putting bones in their noses, the only difference is that since the frontier closed, the evil has been turned back on its own engine, has become rarified, omnipresent, and invisible. It grafts together with blood every high rise and every acre of grazing land in the country. No longer can the American self-assuredly point to and abitrarily declare something to be the doomed object of one's righteous, violent struggle. He can only gesture wildly and blindly in every direction, flinging salt over what's left of the earth as the very sound and fury that was once his claimed vigor and virtue consumes him in body, mind, and spirit alike.<br>&emsp;&emsp;There is no nihilistic vengeance, no self-immolation, no tragedy in the classical sense. There is nothing to inspire any kind of emotional bouyancy, particularly of the kind that many men of my granddad's generation erotically repress as a sort of pastime and way to engage with their peers. Notable that he loved <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, but probably because it delivers much of the same horror as the Coens have done here (and a far greater, more intractable horror, at that) without talking to you, without presenting the horror in it's localized or first-degree manifestation. It also has a lot of good jokes and Slim Pickins goes yahoooeeeyyy at the end which can all be pretty distracting for the average baby boomer, and they're liable to walk away grinning, rubbing their belly, satisfied that the world is, really, so very different from all of that. Those goofy Russians sure are goofy. I am grateful that the Coen brothers did not choose to include any goofy Russians in <i>No Country for Old Men</i>. </td>

  <td>&emsp;&emsp;"The perfect aggrieved Nixonian subject." To come away from this with only a resentment for Kroc contra the brothers is to miss the point I think. The brothers are also Ray Kroc! They're just less select-able by the capitalist machine because they have an *aesthetic* qualm (not to be confused with a moral qualm, but the brother's don't make some great effort to even present it as such) with the imperatives of that machine. Abstract artistic or social values can survive in the system only insofar as they get expressed through the mechanisms of exploitation and narrow self-interest, but as soon as they run against something with a greater recognition of its narrow self-interest and unburdened by those abstract values, they get annihilated. The longer this persists, the more we get remade in the image of what floats to the top, and before long we're all Ray Kroc.</td>
